<h2> My favorite rapper is Ghost Mountain, He was apart of the group called Haunted Mound. The group currently consists of 5 members, Sematary, Hackle, Buckshot, Oscar18 and Anvil. Anvil isn't an offical member but come on, He literally licks Sematary asshole. Ghost Mountain was the JESUS of Haunted Mound, It's a shame sematary got butt-hurt that he can't spit FIRE bars like Ghost Mountain so he kicked him out. </h2>

<h2> I would really love to drive a hearse but I think it's illegal in my country, i'm not really sure and i'm too lazy to check so i probably won't be driving one anytime soon, hearse's are really cool though, you can like sleep in it and stuff. Another really cool car i'd like is a chevy nova, They just look cool as fuck.</h2>
